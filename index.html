		<h2>What makes me happy?</h2>
		<p>Travelling makes me the happiest! It allows me to escape from my daily life and to break the routine in which I am settled. Going on an adventure into the unknown makes me do extraordinary things in an environment that is often very different from what I am used to.</p>
